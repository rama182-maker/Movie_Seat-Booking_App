This is an app made using Javascript in which user can select the seats in a movie Theatre for different movies and price is displayed based on number of seats selected and movie selected.

And,when the user closes the app the data is stored (here local device storage) and when opened again the data stored is replicated into the app accordingly.The data remains safe.

Further features are to be added!
